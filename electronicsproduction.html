      <h2>Electronics Production</h2>
      <p>
        In this chapter, we learnt how to operate a CNC machine to mill out a printed circuit board (PCB).
        We then soldered various components onto the pcb to creat the in-system programming (ISP)
        programmer.
      </p>
      </p>
      <h3><u>What is a pcb?</u></h3>
      <p>
        Printed Circuit Board or PCB are used to configure all the electronic components of a 
        device together. The traces of a circuit board connects all of the electrical signals 
        from one junction to another. In our last module, we used an Arduino to help us assemble 
        our circuit. Now going up a level higher, we learnt how to build our own PCB. This means 
        we have the flexibilty to design and customise our microcontroller board for better product
        integration.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Step 1: EAGLE</u></h3>
      <p>
        The first step to creating our own pcb is to draw out our electrical circuit. Hence, we would
        be using <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&amp;term=1-YEAR&amp;
        support=ADVANCED&amp;quantity=1">EAGLE</a> to draw out our electrical circuit and from there,
        i generated a png file of the traces and outline.
      </p>

        <img src="./images/fts_mini_cut.png"width="49%">
      </p>
      <h3><u>Step 2: G-code</u></h3>
      <p>
        In the second step, after obtaining a png file of the circuit layout and outline, i used the 
        <a href="https://skeatz.github.io/mods/">mods</a> to set the G-code. To enable the programme,
        right click to begin > programs > open programs > G-code: mill 2D pcb. On the programme itself,
        i clicked on "mill traces" for the traces and "mill outline" for the outlines. Making sure to 
        adhere to certain settings like cut depth and tool diameter provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/mods1.png"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/mods2.png"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/cncsettings.png"width="65%"class="center">
      </p>
      <h3><u>Step 3: Milling</u></h3>
      <p>
        After the G-code has been generated, i could prepare a board to start the milling process, but
        before that, i had to set the X and Y origin and thereafter the Z axis in which a probe was
        used. The next step was to add paste the board onto the cardboard base with double-sided tape
        and masking tape to make sure that the board does not shift during the milling process.
      </p>
      <p>>
        <img src="./images/taped board.png"width="65%"class="center">
      </p>
      <p>
        The correct cutter must then be chosen for the correct cutting process, 0.1mm 30 degree V bit
        for etching and a 0.8mm end mill bit for cutting the outline.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/1mm 30deg.png"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/0.8 mm bit.png"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
        The 0.1mm 30 degree V bit was then installed and before starting the etching process on the 
        board.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/electronics prod 3 (2).jpeg"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/helloworldboard.jpeg"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
        After the etching process is completed, the outline can now be milled. Hence, i changed the
        cutter to the 0.8mm end mill bit and without changing the origin of the X and Y axis,
        the Z axis was recallibrated, before the outline of the board was milled.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/electronics prod 4.jpeg"width="65%"class="center">
      </p>
      <p>
        The board was then sanded slighly with fine sand paper to remove any burs created during the
        milling process. 
      </p>
      <h3><u>Step 4: Soldering</u></h3>
      <p>
        After the board was sanded, the components was ready to be soldered onto the board.
      </p>
      <p>
        I reffered to Brianâ€™s board image and schematic to determine if the components are placed 
        correctly in the right orrientation.
      </p>
      <p><img src="./images/fabtinyisp board img.png"width="65%"class="center"></p>
      <p>
        And with a pair of tweazers and a solderin iron equipped with the smallest tip, i started to
        solder the components onto the board making sure to use as little solder as possible.

      <p>
        The cable to connect the ISP programmer to another programmer was also created using 2 heads
        and some wires
      </p>
