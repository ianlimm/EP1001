      <h2>Molding and Casting</h2>
      <p>
        In the segment, i will be learning how to produce 3D shapes through the process of creating a 
        mold and casting it to produce the final product.
      </p>
      <h3><u>Step 1: Design</u></h3>
      <p>
        Similar to the other assignments, the first step was to design the shape that i wanted on 
        Fusion360. I made a cone shape and cut out a sphere at the top of the cone, making sure that
        the height of the cone is 15mm tall.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
          Next, i created the walls of height 20mm and 5mm thickness. This is to create sort of a 
          container to store the silicon for creating the cast later on. It is also very important that
          the height of the cone is smaller that the height of the walls. I then joined them together
          finalising the product.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
          The next step was to generate the G-code using Fusion360, I then switched the modes from 
          Design to Manufacturing.I decided to split the process of milling my mould out into two parts 
          (Roughing and Finishing).Using the pocketing function, it will allow the mill to clear large 
          quantities of material in the mold.
      </p>
      <p>
          The first step was to create a new tool for the cutting process, hence i defined it's geomatry 
          after a 3mm end mill.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/cuttergeom.png"width="65%"class="center">
      </p>
      <p>
          I then defined its toolpath perimeters, editing its feed, speed, spindle speed and cutting 
          feedrate. I also created a new set of parameters for Passes, edited Stepover and Stepdown.
          I also added in stock to leave as this was only the roughing cut of the mold.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/cutting1.png"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/cutting2.png"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
          I then simmulated the roughing cut to make sure it was cutting everything correctly, before 
          moving on the creating the toolpath for the finishing cut.
      </p>
      <p>
          For the finishing cut, there were some factors that were edited to make sure the cutting and 
          finishing was smooth. The excess stock to leave was also unchecked, the feedrate and cutting 
          speed were also reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/cutting3.png"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/cutting4.png"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
          I simmulated the entire cutting process from start to finiss and after checking that 
          everything was correct, i went on the generate the G-code using the post process function.
          I selected the correct CNC machine that i was using, and coppied the file onto a thumbdrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/sim2.png"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/gcode1.png"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
          The next step was to prepare CNC machine for cutting out my mold. I first stuck the foam onto
          the bed of the machine using double-sided tape to secure it onto the machine. I then loaded 
          the NC file contatining the Gcode onto the laptop, set up the X, Y and Z axis. And thereafter,
          started the milling process.

      <h3><u>Final Mold</u></h3>

      <p>
          Next, i put on gloves for safety, before mixing a 1:1 ratio of ___ for the silicon mixture. 
          The mixture was then stired for a few minutes, to ensure that the silicon was well mixed
          together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/silicon1.jpg"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/silicon2.jpg"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
          Next, the silicon mixture was poured onto one corner of the mold so as to prevent any air 
          bubbles being formed in the mold. To further ensure that there were no air bubbles formed 
          in the mold, I lightly tapped the mold onto the table a few times.
      </p>
      <p><img src="./images/molding2.jpg"width="65%"class="center"></p>
      <p>
          The mold was then left to set over the weekend, to ensure that it has fully hardened.
      </p>
      <p>
          Next, i removed the mold from the foam, and cleaned it up abit to prepare it for the next 
          step.
      <p>
        <p><img src="./images/cast1.jpg"width="65%"class="center"></p>
      <p>
          Continuing with the process, i mixed up a mixture of resin, and repeated the steps of pouring 
          the mixture into the cast.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="./images/resin1.jpg"width="49%">
        <img src="./images/resin2.jpg"width="49%">
      </p>
      <p>
          The resin was the poured into the cast, using the same method of pouring it into on of the 
          four corners. The resin was then left to set for about 2 hours, while it hardened completely.
          To give the final product.
